ðŸ“± Personal Portfolio - Raviteja Boddula

This is my personal portfolio website:  
ðŸ‘‰ **https://ravitejaboddula.github.io/Portfolio/**

I built it using only **Semantic HTML** and **Vanilla CSS**, without any frameworks.  
The goal was to keep everything simple, clean, and mobile-friendly.


âœ¨ What I Used

- **HTML5** for structure (with semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- **CSS3** for styling (no Bootstrap, no Tailwind â€” just pure CSS)

ðŸ“Œ Why I Made This

I wanted to:
- Showcase my basic web development skills
- Practice using clean and meaningful HTML structure
- Build something lightweight and easy to understand
- Create a personal space to display my projects and info


ðŸ“‚ How to View or Use

You can:
- Visit the live link directly
- Or clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser

This project is mainly for learning and personal use.

Thanks for checking it out!
